# subglacial_conduit_hydraulics_CFD
A repository for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of subglacial conduit hydraulics. Within this repository, we have solvers, tools, and case setups for the CFD simulations of turbulent flows within subglaical conduits. 

This work is based on the open source CFD platform OpenFOAM.
