How to run the case.

### Prerequisites
1. Linux system (e.g., Ubuntu)
2. OpenFOAM (version 3.0.x)
3. MPI if runing with parallel processors.

### Usage.
1. Using chomod +x name to modify "Allclean" and "Allrun" into executables.
2. Runing "Allclean" first, and then run "Allrun".
3. When the runing is done, the mesh has been generated, however, we need
   to modify the boundary patch in constant/polyMesh/boundary file.
   For the current case, there are 10 patches in the boundary file. 
   We need to delete unused patches (from blockMesh), including "leftB,rightB,
   frontB, backB,bottomB, topB", and keep the other patches. When we delete
   patches, we need to change the patch number in the boundary file. 
4. In current case, we used mapped interal boundary to get fully developed
   inlet flow. Thus, the patch "left" in the boudary file has to be modified. 
   The nFaces and startFace should not be changed. The type should be changed.
   And also, we need to set some extra parameters for the mapped boundary. 
5. An example boundary file is provided here with a name "boundary.example",
   please refer to that file for modifying boundaryies.
6. Initial and boundary conditions: copy the 0.org into 0.
7. When it comes to runing the case. Please first choose if you are running
   in a seriel mode or in parallel mode.
   If in series model, uncomment the "runApplication $application"
   If in parallel mode, first assign the "numberOfSubdomains" in system/decomposerParDict
   , and then uncommet the commands in "Multiple processors" in "Allrun".
